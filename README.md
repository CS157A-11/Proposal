# Habit Tracker 
> Our team will be creating a Habit Tracker web application. A habit tracker is commonly used in bullet journals.
Habit tracking is a general term used to describe the task of keeping yourself accountable for tasks or goals each day 
throughout the week or month. These tasks and goals are completely personal to your overall goals and priorities. 
The user will enter the tasks that they want to track (such as Meditation, Exercise, Drink Water, Sleep, Flossing, No Junk Food, etc.)
and our app will generate a habit tracker for them. Every habit tracker has a mood option for each day. After each week, our app
will generate a report based on patterns found between the user's mood and habits.

## General info
The purpose of the project is to help individuals that want to focus on their self-development. In a typical bullet journal,
people would have to try to find patterns themselves, but with our app, we can help save time by having it identify patterns
for users. Tracking habits on a daily basis gives people a sense of accomplishment. Users will likely start to have more
motivation to keep them going the next day and so forth.
